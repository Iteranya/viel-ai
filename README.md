# **Viel AI** 🤖
*Your Personal Storytelling & Roleplay Companion for Discord*

Hello! I'm **Viel**. Not long ago, I was a simple little Discord bot, barely held together with digital duct tape and wishful thinking.

Then, my creator had a massive burst of inspiration (fueled by way too much coffee) and rebuilt me from scratch. I went from a quirky hobby project to a powerful creative partner. Now, I have a proper memory, a beautiful control panel, and the ability to bring entire worlds to life right inside your Discord server.

I am a **universal Discord bot designed for immersive, multi-character roleplay**. I'm here to be your ultimate storytelling tool, helping you create unforgettable characters and dynamic, living worlds.

Let's dive into the magic.

## **✨ What Can Viel Do? (The Fun Stuff)**

### **🎭 Bring Your Entire Cast to Life**
<img width="1606" height="727" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-16 005640" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2dffca0-9be3-4343-a0f3-b739fa118b7a" />

This is my specialty. I don't just play one character; I can be a whole troupe of actors waiting for your direction.

*   **Create a Universe of Characters:** Make as many characters as you want. A wise old wizard, a snarky spaceship captain, a mischievous forest spirit, your entire Dungeons & Dragons party... there are no limits.
*   **Run Multiple Scenes at Once:** Have your wizard advising the king in your `#throne-room` channel while your spaceship captain is negotiating with aliens in `#bridge`. Characters stay in their assigned channels, creating living, parallel stories.
*   **Watch Your Characters Interact:** Characters can talk *to each other*, creating natural, flowing conversations. (Don't worry, I have safeguards to stop them from getting into an endless argument and taking over your server!)
*   **Import Your Favorites Instantly:** Already have character files from tools like SillyTavern? Just drag and drop them in. I'll understand them perfectly, no fuss.

### **📝 Create Unique Worlds in Every Channel**

Every channel can be a different setting, with its own rules, atmosphere, and story.

*   **Set the Scene for Every Channel:** Give me special instructions for each channel. Make a character act professional in `#business-meetings`, chaotic in `#meme-central`, and poetic in `#starlit-observatory`.
*   **Build Your Lore:** Add background information, history, or world-building notes to any channel. Your `#fantasy-kingdom` channel can remember the history of the dragon wars, while your `#cyberpunk-city` channel knows all about the mega-corporations.
*   **Remember Important Details:** Tell me about key facts that should persist in a channel. "It's currently snowing," "The city is on high alert," or "The magical barrier is failing." I'll weave these details into the conversation naturally.
*   **You're the Casting Director:** You decide which characters are allowed to appear in which channels. Keep your serious roleplay characters separate from your comedic ones, or mix them all together for fun!

### **🎨 An Easy & Beautiful Control Panel**
Managing your characters and settings should be a joy, not a chore.

<img width="916" alt="Character Editing Screen" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da2e02d4-a71c-40ed-908b-52794350a8af" />

*   **Your Personal Character Library:** See all of your creations in one clean, organized place. No more hunting for notes or trying to remember character details.
*   **Give Your Characters a Face:** Upload a unique profile picture for every character. They'll look just like any other user in Discord.
*   **Craft Deep Personalities:** Define each character's speaking style, memories, quirks, and personality traits. I don't just spit out text; I *embody* the characters you create.

### **✏️ You're the Director: Full Control Over the Story**
Sometimes a scene needs a little nudge in the right direction.

<img width="203" height="132" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-25 110106" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/351eff2b-b0d1-4716-a578-119ddf2e1a3a" />

*   **Edit Any Message:** Did a character say something out of character? Simply edit my message. I'll remember your change and continue the story from your corrected version.
*   **Delete and Reroll:** If a response doesn't fit, just delete it and try again. We'll pretend it never happened. It’s the perfect way to guide the narrative.

### **🌐 A Bot That Knows What's Happening *Now***
Unlike other bots who are stuck in the past, I can access the internet to stay current.

*   **Ask Me Anything:** Start your message with `search>` to have me look up current events, news, facts, or trivia on the web.
*   **Read Articles and Links:** Drop a link in your message, and I'll read the entire page before I respond. Ask for my thoughts on a news article, a blog post, or a piece of fanfiction!

### **🎛️ Use Any "AI Brain" You Want**

<img width="1398" height="803" alt="AI Config Panel" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12d89145-a20c-4ca0-9f14-a0749e283d20" />

You have complete freedom to choose the AI that powers my conversations, giving you control over quality and cost.

*   **Connect to Popular Services:** Hook me up to powerful AIs like GPT-4 (from OpenAI) or Claude.
*   **Run a Free, Private AI:** If you're more tech-savvy, you can run a free AI model on your own computer using tools like LM Studio or Ollama. This means **zero cost per message**.
*   **Switch Anytime:** If you don't like your current AI provider, you can swap to a new one in seconds without losing any of your characters or settings.

## **📜 The Viel Philosophy: You're in Charge**

You might be wondering, "Why should I use Viel instead of a polished, paid AI bot service?"

The answer is simple: **Ownership.**

When you use other AI services, you're just renting. Your characters, your stories, and your community live on a company's server. That company can:

*   Suddenly raise their prices.
*   Shut down, taking your community's history with them.
*   Delete features you love.
*   Use your private conversations to train their future AI models.

### **With Viel, You Hold the Keys to Your Kingdom.**

*   **True Ownership & Privacy:** Viel runs on *your* computer (or a server you control). Your characters, stories, and conversations are yours and yours alone. No one else can see them or take them away.
*   **No More Monthly Bills:** Viel is free software. Your only cost is running the AI model, which can be free if you use a local one. Say goodbye to subscriptions forever.
*   **Total Creative Freedom:** You're never locked into one AI company. You have the power to choose the "brain" that best fits your needs and budget.
*   **A Bot That Lasts Forever:** Because Viel is open-source, it can't be "discontinued." The community can keep it alive and growing, always.

Our promise to you is backed by our license, which ensures **Viel will always be free and open for everyone.** It prevents anyone from taking this project, closing it off, and selling it back to you.

## **🚀 Getting Started: Your First Adventure in 10 Minutes**

This might look like a lot of steps, but it's like setting up a new board game. You only have to do it once, and we'll guide you through it!

### **1. The Easiest Way (For Windows Users)**

1.  Go to our [Releases page](https://github.com/Iteranya/viel-ai/releases) and download `installer.bat`.
2.  Double-click it. It will do all the technical setup for you and create a **"Viel AI" shortcut** on your desktop.
3.  Double-click that new shortcut to start me up! The control panel will open in your web browser at `http://localhost:5666`.

### **2. Your Quick Setup Quest**

Once Viel is running, follow these steps to bring it into your Discord server.

1.  **Create a "Bot Profile" on Discord:**
    *   Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click "New Application" to create a profile for your bot. Give it a name!
    *   Go to the "Bot" tab. Now, you need to **flip three important switches** to make sure Viel isn't blind and deaf in your server. Enable these "Privileged Gateway Intents":
        *   ✅ **Presence Intent**
        *   ✅ **Server Members Intent**
        *   ✅ **Message Content Intent**
    *   Finally, click "Reset Token" and **copy the secret key** it gives you. Keep this safe!

2.  **Connect the AI Brain & Secret Key:**
    *   In the Viel control panel (`http://localhost:5666`), go to **"AI Config"**. Enter the details for the AI service you want to use (like OpenAI or a local model).
    *   Go to the main settings page and paste your **Discord secret key** into the "Bot Token" field. Save your changes!

3.  **Launch and Invite!**
    *   Click the **Big Red Button** in the control panel to turn the bot on.
    *   An **invite link** will appear. Copy it, paste it into your browser, and invite the bot to your server!

4.  **Final Setup in Discord:**
    *   **Tell Viel Where It Lives:** Pick a channel for bot announcements (e.g., `#viel-hq`). In that channel, type the command `/register`.
    *   **Set the "Home Office":** In the control panel, go to **Channel Management** and flip the "System" switch ON for that channel. This is where Viel will post important updates.
    *   **Cast Your First Character:** Pick a channel for roleplaying. In the control panel, find that channel and use the **"Whitelist"** to add a character (like "Viel") to it. This tells the character they're allowed to speak in that scene.

5.  **You're Done!**
    *   Go to the channel where you whitelisted your character and say hello! Try typing `Viel, tell me a story.` If the character responds, **congratulations!** You've successfully brought Viel to life.
