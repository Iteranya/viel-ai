# 🛡️ The Free Open Source Software Pledge (a.k.a. The Shoot Myself On The Foot License)

I, Artes Paradox ([@Iteranya](https://github.com/Iteranya/)), the original author and benevolent nerd behind this codebase (hereafter referred to as “Past Me”), hereby make the following **eternal**, **irrevocable**, and **legally inconvenient** pledge regarding this project:

## 🔓 License

This project is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 only (AGPL-3.0-only)**. This license shall apply **forever** to:

- All versions of this project
- All forks of this project
- All derivations of this project
- All renamed, rebranded, or “technically-a-separate-product” versions that are functionally equivalent
- Any component, submodule, plugin, or extension created as part of this project, past, present, or future

Neither I, nor any potential evolution of me (including but not limited to Startup Founder Me™, Sellout Me™, Midlife Crisis Me™, or AI-generated Me v2.0™), may **relicense, restrict, monetize**, or otherwise corrupt the spirit of this software under **any proprietary or more restrictive license**.

## 🚫 No Paywalls, No Premium Nonsense

I solemnly and dramatically swear that I shall **never, ever**:
- Lock any portion of this project behind a paywall
- Offer “premium”, “pro”, “enterprise”, or “unicorn elite” editions
- Introduce “donor-only” features, “early access” gimmicks, or “supporter perks”
- Sell out for VC funding, IPO dreams, or fancy ergonomic chairs with lumbar support

If I (or anyone else) attempts any of the above, it shall be considered a betrayal of this pledge and grounds for:
- Public roasting in meme format
- Permanent record in Git commit history
- Legal action from literally **anyone** with a copy of this file and a sense of justice

## 🏗️ Rewrites Allowed (with Conditions)

If someone (including Future Me) **completely rewrites** this project from scratch in another language (e.g. Rust, Haskell, Brainf*ck), and does not reuse any significant portion of this original codebase, then — and only then — they may relicense it however they wish.

This pledge does **not** apply to rewrites where someone just slaps a new UI on top or adds a few API endpoints. Nice try.

## ☁️ SaaS Hosting? Be My Guest

You are explicitly permitted to:
- Run this project as a hosted service
- Offer paid hosting or managed deployments
- Modify and enhance it (as long as your changes also follow the AGPL-3.0-only license and are made publicly available)

Just don’t pretend you wrote the original. Attribution isn’t just nice — it’s **mandatory**.

## 💸 Donations Are Fine 

If Future Me wants to add a polite little “Please Donate” button on the project page, demo site, or even tucked lovingly into the corner of the interface — that’s totally fine. We all gotta eat, and Ramen’s not getting cheaper.

But here's the deal:
- Donations must always be optional — no features, perks, or bonus content for paying.
- No guilt-tripping, no pop-ups, no “wait before you go” tricks.
- And most importantly: users must be able to easily **permanently** dismiss or hide the donation prompt with a single click or setting. No hoops, no hacks, no "inspect element" nonsense.

This software is a gift to the world — not a vending machine with moral pressure.
## ⚖️ Enforcement Clause of Doom™

Should I, or anyone else, violate this pledge, you (yes, *you*, dear reader) are granted full permission to:
- Present this file and its Git history as binding evidence
- Publicly shame the violator with memes, tweets, blog posts, or TikToks
- Fork the project, restore the license, and continue the true path of righteousness
- Sue me into another dimension (or at least small claims court)

---

**Signed (of sound mind and rebellious spirit), on the 19th of June, 2025**  
**— [Artes Paradox](https://github.com/Iteranya/)**  
*Long live the free and the forked.*
